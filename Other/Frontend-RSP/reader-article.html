                <p><h2>The Role of Nanotechnology in Medicine</h2></p>
                <p style="padding-top: 1rem; width: 60vw;">
                  Nanotechnology has extensive application as nanomedicine in the medical field. Some nanoparticles have possible applications in novel diagnostic instruments, imagery and methodologies, targeted medicinal products, pharmaceutical products, biomedical implants, and tissue engineering. Today treatments of high toxicity can be administered with improved safety using nanotechnology, such as chemotherapeutic cancer drugs. Further, wearable gadgets can detect crucial changes in vital signs, cancer cell conditions, and infections that are genuinely happening in the body. We anticipate these technologies to provide doctors with considerably much better direct access to critical data on the reasons for changes in the signs of life or illness because of the technological presence at the source of the problem. Biomedicine can be utilised for therapies with predictive analytics and artificial intelligence. For carrying out this study, relevant papers on Nanotechnology in the medical field from Scopus, Google scholar, ResearchGate, and other research platforms are identified and studied. The study discusses different types of Nanoparticles used in the medical field. This paper discusses nanotechnology applications in the medical field. The class, features, and characteristics of Nanotechnology for medicine are also briefed. Scientists, governments, civil society organisations, and the general public will need to collaborate across sectors to assess the significance of nanotechnology and guide its advancement in various fields. The current research includes several possible Nanotechnology uses in the medical field. As a result, the study provides a brief and well-organised report on nanotechnology that should be valuable to researchers, engineers, and scientists for future research projects.
